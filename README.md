*The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas. R. ARRGH Ahhh.*

You downloaded data from the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas.

You want to read it into R.

Trying makes you go "ARRGH!"

This package makes you go "ahhhh."


**IN DEVELOPMENT, NO DOCUMENTATION**

**FUNCTIONS PROBABLY WORKING THOUGH IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY YOUR LUCK**

`read.vba` will read in a vba csv and get rid of the annoying top and bottom lines

`process.vba` is a little more complicated but runs `read.vba` then processes geometry and renames some columns, removes others, converts counts into presence absence

Use at your own risk
