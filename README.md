*The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas. R. ARRGH Ahhh.*

You downloaded data from the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas.

You want to read it into R.

Trying makes you go "ARRGH!"

This package makes you go "ahhhh."


**IN DEVELOPMENT, NO DOCUMENTATION**

**FUNCTIONS PROBABLY WORING THOUGH IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY YOUR LUCK**

Just read in a downloaded csv file to `read.vba`. `process.vba` is a little more complicated/sophisticated...
